# AnDO-Project

The Animal Data Organization (AnDO) is a set of specifications for the organization of a directory containing experimental data recorded in animals. It is very inspired by the BIDS specifications ( https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io  ). The main difference lies in the fact that in experiments conducted with animals, it is very common to have different settings for different sessions, and more importantly for different animals (whereas research on human subjects tends to have exactly the same protocol used for all subjects, as looked after by the BIDS specifications).

This project is composed of three main scrip :

-AnDOChecker script that check if your dataset follows AnDO rules
-AnDOGenerator script that create a dataset based on a CSV files
-AnDOViewer script that display your dataset directory in a convenient way.

usage: AnDOViewer.py [-h] [-S] [-Se] [-Su] [-Ss] pathToDir

positional arguments:
  pathToDir             Path to the folder to show
  
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -S, --show            show dir structure
